# Circle-Catch-Game
    This is a old school type gotcha! game where you simply have to click on the three moving circles which will award you points!
    
    The game starts after the program is compiled and run. It opens up in a seperate unintrusive window with the three circles being 
 immediatly displayed to the user.

    The three circles move at different speed where the user gets points added to their total score based on the speed of the circle they manage
to click on. The game is only for 15 seconds and they user is congratulated if the total score at the end is more than 1000. Afterwards 
the user is prompted to end the game by clicking on window which closes the window. 

  
    The purpose of the program was to simply create a simple game and to try to understand the use of inheritance in Java and how one would 
import libraries or inherit classes to create a custom "product". It was also an exercise on understanding the easy of linking user action
to specific instructions being used. And lastly it was just a way to understand the importance of user experience a little. Some of the 
things I were keeping in mind were making sure all the instructions or messages were legible against the backdrop of solid color canvas;
trying to make sure the game was balanced in its point system and also being sure to leave clear instructions for the user to follow.
